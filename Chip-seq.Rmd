```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries (install these first manually in the Console!)
library(ChIPseeker)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
library(GenomicFeatures)
```

## 1. Read in Myc Mel Replicate Peak Files

```{r read-peak-files, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load peak files
rep1_file <- "C:/Users/Asus/OneDrive/Desktop/RStudio assessment/Chip-seq/mycmelrep1_peaks.xls"
rep2_file <- "C:/Users/Asus/OneDrive/Desktop/RStudio assessment/Chip-seq/mycmelrep2_peaks.xls"

rep1_peaks <- readPeakFile(rep1_file)
rep2_peaks <- readPeakFile(rep2_file)
```

## 2. Find Common Peaks

```{r common-peaks, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Find overlapping/common peaks
overlaps <- findOverlaps(rep1_peaks, rep2_peaks)
common_peaks <- rep1_peaks[queryHits(overlaps)]

# View the first few common peaks
head(common_peaks)
```

## 3. Rank Peaks by Fold Enrichment and Select Top 500

```{r rank-top-peaks, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Rank by fold enrichment (descending)
ranked_peaks <- common_peaks[order(common_peaks$fold_enrichment, decreasing = TRUE)]

# Select top 500 peaks
top_500_peaks <- head(ranked_peaks, 500)

# View top ranked peaks
head(top_500_peaks)
```

## 4. Resize Peaks to 200bp Around Center

```{r resize-and-filter, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Resize each peak to 200bp centered on its midpoint
resized_peaks <- resize(top_500_peaks, width = 200, fix = "center")

# Get chromosome lengths from the hg19 genome
genome_lengths <- seqlengths(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)

# Ensure chromosome names match
seqlevelsStyle(resized_peaks) <- "UCSC"

# Assign seqlengths to resized_peaks so we can validate them
seqlengths(resized_peaks) <- genome_lengths[names(seqlengths(resized_peaks))]

# Keep only peaks that are within the chromosome boundaries
valid_peaks <- resized_peaks[start(resized_peaks) > 0 & end(resized_peaks) <= seqlengths(resized_peaks)[as.character(seqnames(resized_peaks))]]

# Check how many peaks are valid
length(valid_peaks)

```

## 5. Extract DNA Sequences from hg19

```{r extract-sequences, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fix chromosome naming style
seqlevelsStyle(resized_peaks) <- "UCSC"

# Extract DNA sequences using hg19 reference genome
seqs <- getSeq(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19, valid_peaks)

# Check first few sequences
head(seqs)
```

## 6. Write Sequences to FASTA File

```{r write-fasta, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a unique identifier for each peak (e.g., peak name or ID)
names(seqs) <- paste("peak", seq_along(seqs), sep="_")

# Write the extracted sequences to a FASTA file
fasta_file <- "extracted_sequences.fasta"
writeXStringSet(seqs, filepath = fasta_file)

# Check that the FASTA file is written in the working directory
list.files()

```

## 7. Final Check: Number of Sequences

```{r check-length, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Ensure 500 sequences are present
length(seqs)
```
